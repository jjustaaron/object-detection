Client Application Development:

Developed a Java Swing-based GUI client application for image selection and processing.
Implemented user interface components using JTabbedPane, JPanel, JLabel, and JButton.
Integrated image file chooser functionality using JFileChooser and FileNameExtensionFilter.
Implemented image display with dynamic resizing using ImageIcon and Image classes.
Managed client-server communication via sockets, including establishing connections, sending data, and receiving responses.
Handled error detection and user notifications using JOptionPane.
Server Application Development:

Designed and implemented a multithreaded Java server to handle concurrent client connections.
Used ServerSocket and Socket classes for network communication.
Developed server-side logic to process client requests for image analysis and object detection.
Integrated image processing and recognition functionalities with external libraries (if applicable).
Implemented logging mechanisms to track server activities and errors.
Technical Skills:
Programming Languages: Java
Libraries & Frameworks: Java Swing for GUI development
Networking: Socket programming, client-server architecture
Tools: JFileChooser for file selection, ImageIcon for image handling
Software Development Practices: Exception handling, multithreading, GUI design
Version Control: Git (if applicable)
Achievements:
Successfully developed and deployed a client-server application for image recognition.
Improved user experience with a responsive and intuitive GUI.
Enhanced application robustness with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.
Ensured efficient client-server communication with optimized socket programming.
Projects:
Client-Server Image Recognition System:
Description: Developed a Java-based application for recognizing faces and objects in images. The client-side GUI allows users to select and upload images, which are then processed by the server to identify and highlight recognized elements.
Key Features:
User-friendly interface for image selection and display.
Real-time client-server communication for image processing.
Accurate image recognition results displayed back to the client.
Technologies Used: Java, Swing, Socket Programming
